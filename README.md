# GraphQL Mern
Followed the following tutorial video for a MERN stack [GraphQL Crash Course With Full Stack MERN Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcLNfwF04Kw&t=476s) 

Learning Graphql by building a full stack app using the following:
* Server: Express
* DB: Mongoose
* GraphQL
* FrontEnd: React


## Notes
Using MongoDB to get data but using graphql for mutations or changes in data. 

[Example of GraphQl queries](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/fc527bc9a4659ab8de8e8066f3498723) can be tested using 

### File Structure
* client
* server
    * config - used for Db connection
    * models - DB modeling and schemas for Mongoose Db interactions
    * schema - schema for Graphql
